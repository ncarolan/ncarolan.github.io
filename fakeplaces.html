    <p>These are <i>places that do not exist</i>, a collection of imaginary U.S. Census tracts conjured up by the StyleGAN2-ada deep generative model. The real U.S. Census tracts - 74,134 in total - are the most granular official subdivision of the United States. Their unique shapes and features are being chronicled by artist Neil Freeman [<a href="https://placesjournal.org/article/earthward-neil-freeman-everytract">1</a>] through his Twitter bot <a  href="https://twitter.com/everytract">@everytract</a>, which posts aerial photography of every census tract, one tract every half hour. Following other work in ultra-realistic generative creation, notably <i>This Person Do Not Exist</i> [<a href="https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/">2</a>], I probe the artistic realism and creative understanding of state-of-the-art machine learning. This project uses the U.S. Census aerial images to train one of the most highly performant generative models, StyleGAN2-ada [<a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada">3</a>]. The result is a machine-imagined view of artificial geography and communities, some dreamlike and some remarkably real.</p>
